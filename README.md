## Problem 5 - Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Are your ready to perform some *Data Analysis with Python*? In this problem, we'll analyze some fictional tweets and find out whether the overall sentiment of Twitter users is happy or sad. This is a simplified version of an important real world problem called *sentiment analysis*.
